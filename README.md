# HandwritingClassifiers

The aim of this project is to be able to classify images of digits as accurately as possible. In the project, I get a better understanding of kmeans clustering and knearest neighbhors algorithms. To add, I look at the impact PCA has on the preditive models accuracy and time taken to run the algorithm. Also tried to use convolution neural networks (with the aim of getting a better understanding of deep learning).
